# Themed Hybrid UI Component

## Core Purpose
Create a uniquely themed UI component that combines multiple existing UI elements into one elegant solution.

## Output Requirements
- **File Name**: `ui_hybrid_[iteration_number].html`
- **Template Structure**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[Theme Name] Hybrid Component</title>
    <style>
        /* Theme-specific styles here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your themed hybrid component here -->

```

## Design Dimensions

### Theme Development Guide
**Primary Theme Selection**: Choose one distinctive visual/conceptual theme
- **Nature Themes**: Ocean depths, forest canopies, desert landscapes, arctic tundra
- **Era Themes**: Art deco, cyberpunk, steampunk, minimalist modern, brutalist
- **Conceptual Themes**: Data visualization, musical harmony, geometric abstraction, organic flow
- **Emotional Themes**: Serene calm, energetic dynamism, professional authority, playful creativity

**Theme Implementation Strategy**:
- **Color Psychology**: Use colors that reinforce your theme's emotional impact
- **Typography Selection**: Choose fonts that embody your theme's personality
- **Visual Metaphors**: Incorporate theme-related imagery, shapes, or patterns
- **Interaction Patterns**: Design hover, click, and transition effects that match your theme

### Combination Strategies
**Multi-Component Integration**: Select 2-4 UI components to combine
- **Input + Display**: Search bar + results grid, form + preview panel
- **Navigation + Content**: Sidebar menu + content area, tabs + panels
- **Control + Feedback**: Slider controls + visual output, buttons + status indicators
- **Data + Visualization**: Table + chart, timeline + details panel

**Integration Approaches**:
- **Nested Integration**: One component contains others (card containing form + preview)
- **Adjacent Integration**: Components sit side-by-side with shared styling
- **Layered Integration**: Components overlap or stack with z-index relationships
- **Flow Integration**: Components connect in a logical user workflow sequence

## Quality Standards

### Thematically Distinctive
- Every visual element should reinforce your chosen theme
- Color choices, typography, spacing, and imagery should create a cohesive aesthetic
- The theme should be immediately recognizable and memorable
- Avoid generic or bland design choices that could work with any theme

### Functionally Integrated
- Combined components should work together seamlessly
- User interactions should flow naturally between different component areas
- Data or state changes in one component should meaningfully affect others
- The combination should solve a real user problem more effectively than separate components

### Practically Superior
- The hybrid component should outperform using separate components
- Loading performance should be optimized for the combined functionality
- User workflow should be more efficient with the integrated approach
- Responsive design should work smoothly across device sizes

### Technically Excellent
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Efficient CSS with logical organization and reusable patterns
- Smooth animations and transitions that enhance rather than distract
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations

## Iteration Evolution

### Progressive Sophistication
- **Early Iterations**: Focus on solid theme establishment and basic component integration
- **Middle Iterations**: Add sophisticated interactions, micro-animations, and advanced styling
- **Later Iterations**: Explore cutting-edge CSS features, complex state management, innovative UX patterns

### Creative Exploration Paths
- **Theme Depth**: Push your chosen theme to more sophisticated or unexpected places
- **Component Complexity**: Combine more components or add more complex interactions
- **Technical Innovation**: Experiment with newer CSS features, creative layouts, advanced animations
- **User Experience**: Focus on perfecting the user journey and reducing cognitive load

## Ultra-Thinking Directive

### Innovation Requirements
Each iteration must introduce something genuinely new:
- **Unique Theme Application**: Apply your theme in ways not seen in previous iterations
- **Novel Component Combinations**: Try component pairings that haven't been explored
- **Creative Technical Solutions**: Use CSS or HTML in innovative, standards-compliant ways
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Solve usability challenges in fresh, intuitive ways

### Quality Amplification
- **Visual Impact**: Each iteration should be immediately impressive and memorable
- **Functional Elegance**: The component combination should feel inevitable and perfectly suited
- **Technical Craft**: Code quality should demonstrate mastery and attention to detail
- **User Delight**: Interactions should feel smooth, responsive, and satisfying

### Creative Pushing Boundaries
- Don't settle for obvious solutions - explore unexpected approaches
- Combine themes or create theme variations that add depth and interest
- Experiment with cutting-edge CSS features while maintaining broad compatibility
- Think about how your component could inspire or influence other designers

Remember: Your goal is to create UI components that are so well-designed and distinctive that they could serve as inspiration for other developers, demonstrate advanced frontend skills, and solve real-world interface challenges in elegant, themed ways.
