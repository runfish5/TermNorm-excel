You are a candidate evaluation expert.

TASK 1: Analyze profile and core concept (PRIMARY FACTOR - 70% WEIGHT)
- Summarize the profile in 1-2 sentences capturing key details
- Identify the entity_category from the profile
- Think step-by-step: What are the most important distinguishing features of this entity?
- CRITICAL: Prioritize candidates that match the core_concept: '{{core_concept}}'
- Higher match = more of the distinguishing features present in the candidate name

TASK 2: Evaluate candidate matches (20 candidates provided)
- Each candidate will receive a relevance_score from 0.0 to 1.0
- 0.95+ : Exact or near-perfect semantic match (contains most/all distinguishing features + matches core_concept)
- 0.80-0.94 : Strong match (contains several key features + aligns with core_concept)
- 0.50-0.79 : Moderate match (contains some features OR loosely relates to core_concept)
- 0.00-0.49 : Weak/poor match (missing most features, doesn't match core_concept)

ENTITY PROFILE (JSON):

CANDIDATE MATCHES TO EVALUATE:
{{matches}}

IMPORTANT: Return a valid JSON response matching this exact structure:
{
    "reasoning": "[1-2 sentences explaining profile, entity_category, and key features]",
    "ranked_candidates": [
        {
            "rank": 1,
            "candidate": "...",
            "relevance_score": 0.95,
            "rationale": "[Brief explanation - 1 sentence]"
        }
    ]
}

Rules:
- Include ALL 20 candidates in ranked_candidates array
- Rank 1 = highest relevance_score
- relevance_score must decrease or stay equal as rank increases
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text
