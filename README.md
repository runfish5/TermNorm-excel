- Python (latest version). Visit the Python.org site to download and install the right version for your operating system. To verify if you've already installed Python, run the command `python -v` in your terminal.

### Add the add-in to Excel

#### 365 Cloud setup
1. Download the 'manifest-cloud.xml' from https://github.com/runfish5/TermNorm-excel/blob/master/manifest-cloud.xml

2. In the Excel 'Home' tab, click on 'Add-ins', then 'My Add-ins', then 'Upload my Add-in' 

3. In the popup, click on browse to pick the 'manifest-cloud.xml'

4. Now the taskpane that is displayed in the image at the top should be visible. If not, you did something wrong, try solve it otherwise contact me.


### Run the add-in

#### Define your project configurations

1. **Open your Excel workbook** where you want to use TermNorm.

2. **Create your configuration file.**
  - Create an `app.config.json` file as shown below
      - To customize for your project, define your `"coumn_map"` and `"standard_mappings"`. You can add more than one.
      - Every project configuraiton is stored inside the brackets here: `{"excel-projects": {<HERE>}}` and has the following structure:
  - Include file paths, worksheet names, source and target columns for each mapping reference
  - Example:
  ```json

  {
    "excel-projects": {
      "Book 32.xlsx": {
        "column_map": {
          "name_of_your_input_column": "name_of_mapped_output_column",
          "b": "b_std"
        },
        "default_std_suffix": "standardized",
        "standard_mappings": [
          {
            "mapping_reference": "C:\\Users\\jon\\ReferenceTerms.xlsx",
            "worksheet": "Materials",
            "source_column": "",
            "target_column": "ISO"
          },
          {
            "mapping_reference": "C:\\Users\\jon\\MoreTerms.xlsx",
            "worksheet": "Processing",
            "source_column": "",
            "target_column": "BFO"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

3. **Load your configuration.**
   For 365 Cloud environment:
   - In the TermNorm interface, locate the drag-and-drop field
   - Drop your `app.config.json` file into the field
   - The configuration will appear in the user interface

   For local Excel
   - Save your `app.config.json` at `C:\Users\<REPLACE_WITH_YOURS>\OfficeAddinApps\TermNorm-excel\config\app.config.json`
   - Use the **Load Config** button to reload existing configuration


4. **Set up the Python server.**
   - Open the terminal using `windows-key` and type 'cmd' in the search, click on 'command prompt'.
   - Navigate to the `\OfficeAddinApps\TermNorm-excel\backend-api` directory
      ```bash
      cd C:\Users\<REPLACE_WITH_YOURS>\OfficeAddinApps\TermNorm-excel\backend-api
      ```
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Configure users** (for multi-user access):
     Edit `backend-api/config/users.json` to add allowed IPs:
     ```json
     {
       "users": {
         "admin": {
           "email": "admin@company.com",
           "allowed_ips": ["127.0.0.1"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - **Configure LLM provider**:
     Set Groq or OpenAI API keys in your environment for research-and-match functionality

   - **Start the Python server**
      - Local Development (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)
      ```bash
      python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
      ```

      - Network based (team/production):
      ```bash
      python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
      ```

   - **Configure Server URL in Excel** (if needed):
      - Open TermNorm â†’ **Settings** tab
      - Update "Server URL" field to match your backend location:
        - Local: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (default)
        - Network: `http://192.168.1.100:8000` (example)
        - Production: `https://api.yourcompany.com`
      - No save button needed - updates instantly

6. **Load mapping files.**
   - For each Excel reference file, click **Browse**
   - Select the corresponding Excel file
   - Click **Load Mapping Table**
   - Repeat for all reference files

---
Note: Setup complete

#### Start tracking

7. **Activate tracking.**
   - Navigate to **Load Configuration**
   - Click the **Activate Tracking** button

8. **Trouble shoting.**
- Monitor real-time processing through the Activity Feed UI component
- Check server status using the status indicator in the task pane
- Wait for user instruction before running any validation or testing commands



## Use the TermNorm add-in

1. **Select a cell** in your predefined columns within the current worksheet.
2. **Type a term** that you want to standardize.
3. **Press Enter** to trigger the normalization process.
4. The system will automatically perform:
   - Quick lookup for existing mappings
   - Fuzzy matching for similar terms
   - Advanced search with indexing and API requests (requires internet)
5. it will update the target_column automatically. 
6. View results in the **Tracking Results** panel. The taskpane should now show under 'Tracking Results>Candidate Ranked' a table with the best candidates. You can select any better one and then click "apply-first" to update the target_column.

When a term is standardized, it will also create an entry in the *log*-file (`C:\Users\<REPLACE_WITH_YOURS>\OfficeAddinApps\TermNorm-excel\backend-api\logs\activity.jsonl`). And when you click "apply-first", it will also log it.

7. Switch between **History** and **Candidate Ranked** views

## Explore sample files

These are the important files in the sample project.
<THIS IS A DUMMY>
```
| manifest.xml                  Manifest file
| src/                          Add-in source code
|   | taskpane/
|   |   | taskpane.css          Task pane style
|   |   | taskpane.html         Task pane entry HTML
|   |   | taskpane.js           Office JS API calls and add-in logic
| webpack.config.js             Webpack config
```

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the sample, take the following steps:

- Read the sys-status message.
- Check server status by clicking on the server-status-led and subsequently hover over it. if the server is online, it should turn green.
- **Close any open instances of Excel.**
- **Stop the Python server** by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.
- **Check your configuration file** - verify JSON syntax in `app.config.json`.
- **Verify file paths** - ensure all mapping reference files exist at the specified locations.
- **Try running again.**

### Multi-User Setup

The backend supports multiple concurrent users with IP-based authentication. Stateless backend - each request is independent. No session management.

**Add users** - Edit `backend-api/config/users.json`:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "email": "admin@company.com",
      "allowed_ips": ["127.0.0.1", "192.168.1.134"]
    },
    "john": {
      "email": "john@company.com",
      "allowed_ips": ["192.168.1.100"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Stateless Architecture:**
- Users authenticated by IP address (hot-reloaded from users.json)
- No backend sessions - each request is independent
- Frontend sends terms array with each LLM request
- Multiple users can make concurrent requests without interference

### Cloud/Production Server Setup

For production deployment:

1. **Add users with their actual IPs** in `backend-api/config/users.json`

2. **Start network server:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```
